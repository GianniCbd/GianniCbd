Hello, World! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm Gianni Cabiddu, a developer with a deep passion for bringing ideas to life through code. Here, you'll find a collection of projects, experiments, and collaborations that reflect my journey in tech.

👨‍💻 A Bit About Me
I'm a full-stack developer with a knack for creating experiences that people enjoy using. My approach to development is all about balancing functionality and aesthetics — code that not only works but feels intuitive and, dare I say, enjoyable.

💡 Curiosity-Driven: Always exploring new languages, frameworks, and libraries. My favorite part of development is finding elegant solutions to complex problems.
🎨 Creative by Nature: UX/UI design is where my creativity meets my code. Crafting visually engaging interfaces is my playground.
🌱 Lifelong Learner: Technology moves fast, and I love keeping up. Currently diving deeper into Python and the AI "world".
🔨 Projects & Passions

Here’s a little showcase of the projects that have challenged me and helped me grow as a developer. Each one represents a piece of my journey:

🛠 Zoo: A web app that recreates a website for a zoo, developed with Java/Angular and includes a chatbox created with Botpress.
🌐 HospyHelper: My first web app created for the final course project with Epicode, developed with Java.

If you're curious to learn more about any of these, feel free to explore the repositories or reach out to me directly!
